### Coding Standards

#### Java (Backend)
- Follow Java naming conventions
- Use Checkstyle for code style enforcement
- Write Javadoc comments for public APIs
- Keep methods focused and small
- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for high code coverage with JaCoCo

#### General Guidelines
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep commits atomic and well-described
- Follow the conventional commits specification:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation changes
  - `style:` for formatting changes
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

### Testing

- Run checkstyle: `mvn checkstyle:checkstyle@checkstyle-all`
- Run tests: `mvn clean test`
- Generate coverage report: `mvn jacoco:report`

### Git Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```

3. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch

### Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update documentation for any new or changed functionality
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
